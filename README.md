# eMed-DNA

##Abstract 


##Background 
eMED-DNA is a sophisticated pipeline which incorporates compression at different levels,  novel Binary-to-DNA base conversion technique, and an in-DNA file management system to manage the DNA base streams resulting from the EHRs and the dictionary entries. We proposed customized algorithms and computational techniques for each of these key components of eMED-DNA.  In this section we give the full details of these techniques.
